# Lucas Johnson, Front-end Web Developer ~ React/JavaScript

I am Front-end Web Developer with five years of professional experience. I have worked in multiple agency environments, building large corporate websites; either as templates built on top of an existing CMS, or as fully deployed React JS/Redux/TypeScript web applications that are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and thoroughly tested. More recently, I have worked on projects that have required me to create UX/UI designs. I am a team player who is at home in Agile environments, has a keen eye for detail, strong communication skills, and who is able to adjust to the needs of any project.
